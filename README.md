# IMBSM
Natural image matting based on surrogate model (IMBSM) is an computationally efficient image matting algorithm that use surrogate models to approximate the pixel pair evaluation function and the optimal solution of the surrogate model obtained efficiently as the approximate optimal solution of the pixel pair optimization problem.
